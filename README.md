# Trade Card
Application to keep track of the cards in your collection

## Client
A client can be found in the `client` directory. It is written in [Elm][elm]. In
order to build the system move into the directory and execute the following
command

```plain
elm src/TradeCard/Client.elm --output js/client.js 
```

This will update `client.js` with the latest developments.
